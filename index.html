<h2 style="color:blue;"><font face='verdana'>The Basics</h2>
<p66 style="color:blue;">In the current day of age anyone can be anyone and this can lead to many dangerous as people can impersonate others or just lie about who they are. This can lead to scams or false information being spread around though seemingly trustworthy accounts who might just be impersonators. There could be benefits to as it can make free speech easier as people can speak there feelings without feeling they will be punished of course some can take this too far which can lead into more troubles with being anonymous. I believe big media companies such at twitter or instagram have power to publicly influence this issue though changing rules and policies on their sites.</p66>
