<h2 style="color:blue;"><font face='verdana'>The Basics</h2>
<p66 style="color:blue;">In the current day of age, anyone can be anyone. This leads to many dangers due to the fact that people can simply impersonate others or just lie about their identity. This can lead to scams or false information being spread around from seemingly trustworthy accounts who might just be impersonators. There could be benefits as it can make free speech easier as people can express their feelings without feeling they will be punished. Some can take advantage of this factor, which leads to more questions on whether or not being anonymous is as beneficial as it may seem. Some individuals have voiced their own opinions on the matter. Most have stated that they believe big media companies such as Twitter or Instagram have the power to publicly influence this issue by changing rules and policies on their sites, which require identification before being able to use the application.
