<p1><font size="+1	">
Anonymity online poses many issues from hate speech to scams and many more terrible things. The thought of anonymity can make you seem invincible and lead people to do and say things they otherwise wouldn't. Such as saying hateful or racist, homophobic or misogynistic words with many websites having little to no filter to what can be said on their platforms.Scammers are also easily able to impersonate family members or banks to get money from unsuspecting victims.Which can leave an everlasting impact if they get scammed out of a large sum of money. Many of the victims of these scams are older people who don't know the most about the internet this shows how dangerous of a place the internet can be for those who aren't well versed in how its evolved and changed overtime.According to an article from ODU(Old Dominion University) ,"Anonymity can be used to seek contacts for performing illegal acts, like a pedophile searching for children to abuse or a swindler searching for people to rip off." Kids are also very volatile as their brains aren't fully formed so if they are told they are talking to someone they should trust they will believe.</p1>
