As I have shown today, online anonymity can be very dangerous and can lead to foul acts, but how can we fix this? A solution that could be implemented is that of linking some sort of ID to a social media account. This will make it so a person's action can be traced back to them. Another approach could be for websites to change their policies so more serious action is taken against those who use hate speech. Companies like Twitter and Facebook are changing their terms and conditions, along with punishments, which could go a long way to keeping the internet a safer place.</p1>
