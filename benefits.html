<p1><font size="+1">The internet is a vast space. People come to the Internet to do many different things, some of which they may want to not be publicly linked to themselves. Someone might feel they want to make a change and or speak out about a topic but are too scared to in person. For this a person might create an anonymous blog or some other form of news outlet. This can be beneficial for the creator and others. The creator has an outlet to express their thoughts of how to fix and issue and like minded people can interact together and may eventually bring change. And also keeps them safe from others who might not share the same views and could be violent or just rude and insensitive.From https://www.esafety.gov.au, some online websites can be used so conceal identities of marginalized groups such as the LGBTQ+ community and websites that share their full name might make it easier for them to explore themselves without having to worry about prosecution from people close to them that might not have the same beliefs as themselves. Without a doubt anonymity on the internet has it's spot and had been proven beneficial.</p1>
